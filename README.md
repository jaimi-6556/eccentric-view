# Detection of Eccentric Viewing in Low Vision Patients

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting **eccentric viewing behavior** in low vision patients using deep learning techniques. Eccentric viewing is a compensatory strategy used by individuals with central vision loss, where they rely on a peripheral retinal region called the **Preferred Retinal Locus (PRL)** instead of the damaged fovea.

The system analyzes eye movement video data to predict gaze coordinates and identify eccentric viewing patterns, helping support vision rehabilitation and remote monitoring applications.

## Problem Statement
Traditional methods for detecting eccentric viewing rely on specialized eye-tracking hardware and clinical supervision, which are expensive, time-consuming, and not easily accessible. This project aims to provide a **cost-effective, automated, and scalable AI-based solution** for eccentric viewing detection.
